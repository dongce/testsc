<h1>  4. Defining Functions </h1>
<hr>
<h2>1. Introduction </h2>
In the previous chapters, I have explained:
<ol>
  <li> How to install MIT-Scheme.
  <li> How Scheme interpreters evaluate S-expressions.
  <li> Basic list operations.
 </ol>
In this chapter, I will explain how to define your own functions.
As Scheme is a functional programming language, you construct your programs
by building up small functions. Thus, understanding
how to build and combine functions
is critical to master Scheme.
<p>

As it is quite inconvenient to define functions on the front end,
you usually edit codes by an editor and load them to the interpreter.
  
<h2>2. How to define simple functions and to load them</h2>
You use <span class='ttb'>define</span> to bind a symbol to a value.
You can define any kind of global parameters,
such as numbers, characters, lists, etc. and functions by this operator.
<p>
Let's edit the code shown in [code 1] by any kinds of editor (including Notepad),
and save it as 'hello.scm' under a directory like 'C:\doc\scheme\'.
If possible, save under the default directory of MIT-Scheme, which you have defined
in chapter 1.
<p>

[code 1] (hello.scm)
<pre class='code'>
<span class='comment'>; Hello world as a variable</span>
(define vhello "Hello world")     <span class='comment'>;1</span>

<span class='comment'>; Hello world as a function</span>
(define fhello (lambda ()         <span class='comment'>;2</span>
		 "Hello world"))
</pre>

Next, give the following command to the Scheme interpreter. 
<pre class='samp'>
(cd "C:\\doc\\scheme")
<span class='response'>;Value 14: #[pathname 14 "c:\\doc\\scheme\\"]</span>

(load "hello.scm")
<span class='response'>;Loading "hello.scm" -- done</span>
<span class='response'>;Value: fhello</span>
</pre>
By this, <tt>hello.scm</tt> is loaded to the  scheme interpreter.
If the current directory of the interpreter has been set to the directory where the script is,
you don't need the first line.

Then give the following command to the interpreter.
<pre class='samp'>
vhello
<span class='response'>;Value 15: "Hello world"</span>

fhello
<span class='response'>;Value 16: #[compound-procedure 16 fhello]</span>

(fhello)
<span class='response'>;Value 17: "Hello world"</span>
</pre>

The <span class='ttb'>define</span> is a operator to declare variables and takes two arguments.
The operator declares to use the first argument as a global parameter and binds it to the
second argument.
Thus, the line at <span class='comment'><tt>;1</tt></span> in [code 1] means that
it declares a global parameter <tt>vhello</tt> and binds it to "Hello world". <p>
On the other hand, the line at <span class='comment'><tt>;2</tt></span> declares
a procedure that returns "Hello world".<br>
The <span class='ttb'>lambda</span> is a special form to define procedures.
  The <tt>lambda</tt> takes more than one arguments and the first argument is the list of
  parameters that the procedure takes as arguments.
  As  <tt>fhello</tt> takes no argument, the list of the parameters is empty.
  <p>

Give <tt>vhello</tt> to the interpreter then it returns the value, "Hello world".
if you give <tt>fhello</tt>, it also returns the value like, <br><var>#[compound-procedure 16 fhello]</var>,<br>
which means that the Scheme interpreter treats procedures and conventional data type in a same way. 
    As explained in <a href='scheme3_e.html#cons'>the previous chapter</a>, the Scheme interpreter manipulates all
    the data by their addresses in the memory space and any kinds of object existing in the memory can be
    treated in the same way. <br>
  To call <tt>fhello</tt> as a procedure, you should bracket off the symbol like <tt>(fhello)</tt>.
Then the interpreter evaluates it and returns "Hello world"
taking <a href='scheme2_e.html#eval'>steps shown in chapter 2</a>.
      
 
<h2>3. Defining functions with parameters</h2>
Put a list of parameters after <tt>lambda</tt> to define functions with parameters.
Save the code shown in [code 2] as <tt>farg.scm</tt> under the same directory where <tt>hello.scm</tt> is.
<p>
[code 2] (farg.scm)
<pre class='code'>
<span class='comment'>; hello with name</span>
(define hello
  (lambda (name)
    (string-append "Hello " name "!")))


<span class='comment'>; sum of three numbers</span>
(define sum3
  (lambda (a b c)
    (+ a b c)))
</pre>

After saving it, load the file into the interpreter and call the functions.
<pre class='samp'>
(load "farg.scm")
<span class='response'>;Loading "farg.scm" -- done</span>
<span class='response'>;Value: sum3</span>

(hello "Lucy")
<span class='response'>;Value 20: "Hello Lucy!"</span>

(sum3 10 20 30)
<span class='response'>;Value: 60</span>
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><b>hello</b></dt>
      <dd> Function <tt>hello</tt> takes one argument (<tt>name</tt>), appends  "Hello ", <tt>name</tt>, and "!"  and
	returns it.<br>
	A pre-defined function
<span class='ttb'>string-append</span> takes arbitrary number of string arguments and returns a appended string.
</dd>
  <dt><b>sum3</b></dt>
      <dd>It takes three arguments and returns the sum of them.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>4. A short form for function definitions</h2>
Even, using <tt>lambda</tt> is the orthodox way of defining functions.
you can use a short form shown in [code 3].
<p>
  
[code 3]
<pre class='code'>
<span class='comment'>; hello with name</span>
(define (hello name)
  (string-append "Hello " name "!"))


<span class='comment'>; sum of three numbers</span>
(define (sum3 a b c)
  (+ a b c))
</pre>
In this form, functions are defined in the form that they are called.
[code 2] and [code 3] are identical.
Some people don't like the short way of defining functions, but I use it
in this tutorials, because this way makes code shorter.

<h3> Exercise 1</h3>
Write following functions. They are quite simple but useful.
<ol>
<li> A function that add 1 to the argument.
<li> A function that subtract 1 from the argument.
</ol>



<a name='practice'>
<h3> Exercise 2</h3>
Let's write a function to calculate flying distances with following steps.

<ol>
<li> Write a function that convert the unit of angles from degree to radian.<br>
  180 degree is &pi; radian.
  &pi; is defined by<br>
  <tt>(define pi (* 4 (atan 1.0)))</tt><br>
  

<li> Write a function that calculates a distance of moving at a constant velocity (<var>v<sub>x</sub></var>)
  in <var>t</var> seconds.
<li> Write a function that calculates a duration till the object reach the ground that is launched with vertical
  velocity of <var>v<sub>y</sub></var>.<br> 
  Ignore air drag and use <tt>9.8 m s<sup>-2</sup></tt> as the value of acceleration of gravity (<i>g</i>). 
  <br>
  hint: As the vertical velocity when the object reaches the ground is  <var>-v<sub>y</sub></var>,<br>
  <tt>2 v<sub>y</sub> = g t</tt> <br>
  where <tt>t</tt> is the falling duration.
<li> Write a function that calculates a flying distance of a ball
thrown with an initial velocity <var>v</var> and an angle <var>theta</var> degree
  using functions defined in questions 1--3.<br>
Hint: First, convert degree to radian (say <var>theta1</var>).
  The horizontal and vertical initial velocities are represented by <br>
  <var>v</var> <tt>cos</tt>(<var>theta1</var>)
  and <var>v</var> <tt>sin</tt>(<var>theta1</var>), respectively.
  The duration of falling can be calculated by the function of the question 3.
  As horizontal velocity doesn't change, the distance can be calculated using the function of the question 2.
  
 <li> Calculate the distance of a ball thrown with a initial velocity of <tt>40 m s<sup>-1</sup></tt>
  and an angle of 30 degree. It corresponds to the distance of a long cast by a professional baseball player
   having a strong arm.
</ol>

<h2>5. About editors</h2>
I will mention about editors which is convenient to edit Scheme codes. 
<h3>5.1. Emacs</h3>
Windows version of Emacs21 can be downloaded from 
<a href='http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/'>http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/</a>.
Download emacs-21.3-bin-i386.tar.gz and unpack it. <p>

You will find an executable named <tt>runemacs.exe</tt> under directory <tt>bin</tt>.
Double click it to start the editor.
Even the key mapping is quite different from that of Windows standard,
  it is reasonably user friendly because it
 is equipped with a menu bar and mouse control.

You can customize it by editing the configuration file named <tt>.emacs</tt>.
A Scheme mode is available, which understands pre-defined words and indents code
  properly by pressing
   <span class='ttb'>Ctrl-i</span> or <span class='ttb'>TAB</span>. 
In addition, the editor shows corresponding open parenthesis automatically,
when a close parenthesis are typed.<p>
  
On Windows operation system, emacs cannot call MIT-Scheme interactively.
You should save the source code and load it by hand.
On Unix and Linux, on the other hand, emacs can call MIT-Scheme interactively
  and editing codes can be done interactively.


<h3>5.2. Edwin</h3>
Edwin is an editor equipped with MIT-Scheme. It is like emacs18.
As there is no menu bar and no mouse control, it is not user friendly very much.
Only few use this editor and little information is available on the Web.
However, you can edit your codes interactively using this editor.
I use this editor to edit Scheme codes on Windows.

<h4> How to use the Edwin</h4>
  Double click the icon of Edwin to start the  Edwin.
When Edwin has started, a default buffer named *scheme* appears, which corresponds to the
*scratch* buffer of emacs.
You can use *scheme* as a front end of the interpreter. S-expressions are evaluated
by pressing <span class='ttb'>(Ctrl-x, Ctrl-e)</span>.

<h5> a. Open and close files and terminating the editor</h5>
Press <span class='ttb'>(Ctrl-x, Ctrl-f)</span>
to open a file. If you give a file name which does not exist, a new file is created.
As the initial directory is set to 'C:\', you should change directory before open files.
<p>
Press <span class='ttb'>(Ctrl-x, Ctrl-s)</span> to save files and
  press <span class='ttb'>(Ctrl-x, Ctrl-w)</span> to save files with different names.
  To exit from editor press <span class='ttb'>(Ctrl-x, Ctrl-c)</span>.

<h5> b. Indenting</h5>
Press <span class='ttb'>Ctrl-i</span> or <span class='ttb'>TAB</span> to indent.

<h5> c. Cut, copy and paste</h5>
As you cannot use the mouse, copy(cut)/paste is inconvenient a little bit.
Do like as follows:
<ol>
 <li> First, go to the starting position to be selected region by using arrow keys.
   Then press <span class='ttb'>Ctrl-SPACE</span>.
   
 <li>Then go to the ending position and press <span class='ttb'>Ctrl-w</span> or <span class='ttb'>Alt-w</span>
   to cut or copy the selected region, respectively.
 <li> Finally, go to the position where you want paste and press <span class='ttb'>Ctrl-y</span>.
</ol>

<h5> d. Evaluating S-expressions</h5>
<ul>
<li> <span class='ttb'>Alt-z</span> is a key bound to evaluating the S-expression beginning with 
  <tt>define</tt>. It also bind the symbol and value.

<li><span class='ttb'>Alt-:</span> is a key to evaluate S-expressions at the 
  mini buffer. This is often used to test functions evaluated by <span class='ttb'>Alt-z</span>.

<li>At *scheme* buffer, any S-expression can be evaluated by
  <span class='ttb'>(Ctrl-x, Ctrl-e)</span>.
</ul>
 See <a href='http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/documentation/user_8.html'>
   http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/scheme/documentation/user_8.html</a>
and you will get more information about Edwin.
The same document is attached with the MIT-Scheme you have downloaded.

<h2>6. Summary</h2>
In this chapter, I mentioned how to define functions.
A special form <span class='ttb'>define</span> is used to define functions and other global parameters.
Editing source codes by proper editor (like emacs) and loading them is much convenient than
defining functions directly on the front end of the interpreter.
<p>
In the next chapter, I will mention about branching.

<h3>Answers for exercises</h3>
<a name='a1'>
<h4> Answer 1</h4>
<pre class='code'>
; 1
(define (1+ x)
  (+ x 1))

; 2
(define (1- x)
  (- x 1))
</pre>

<h4> Answer 2</h4>
Write codes like as follows:
<pre class='code'>
<span class='comment'>; definition of pi</span>
(define pi (* 4 (atan 1.0)))

<span class='comment'>; degree -> radian</span>
(define (radian deg)
  (* deg (/ pi 180.0)))

<span class='comment'>; free fall time</span>
(define (ff-time vy)
  (/ (* 2.0 vy) 9.8))

<span class='comment'>; horizontal distance </span>
(define (dx vx t)
  (* vx t))

<span class='comment'>; distance</span>
(define (distance v ang)
  (dx
   (* v (cos (radian ang)))                     <span class='comment'>; vx</span>
   (ff-time (* v (sin (radian ang))))))         <span class='comment'>; t</span>
</pre>

After loading to the interpreter, the distance will be
calculated by;
<pre class='samp'>
(distance 40 30)
<span class='response'>;Value: 141.39190265868385</span>
</pre>
The function returns a reasonable value 141.4 m, which is slightly larger because of
ignoring air drag.
