<h1> 18. Nondeterminism   </h1>
<hr>
<h2>1. Introduction </h2>

Nondeterminism is a algorithm to solve a problem by just defining it.
The nondeterminism program selects choices automatically that match the conditions.
This technique suits logical programing.
<p>

For instance, following code returns a pear of two numbers in that sum of them
 is a prime number. One number is selected from <tt>'(4 6 7)</tt> and the other from <tt>'(5 8 11)</tt>,
<pre class='samp'>
(let ((i (amb 4 6 7))
      (j (amb 5 8 11)))
  (if (prime? (+ i j))
      (list i j)
      (amb)))
<span class='response'>;Value 23: (6 5)</span>
</pre>
<tt>(amb 4 6 7)</tt> returns a proper value from 4, 6, and 7 and 
<tt>(amb 5 8 11)</tt> returns a proper value from 5, 8, and 11.
<tt>(amb)</tt> represents the false as there is no value to be selected.
<p>
Actually, <tt>amb</tt> performs a depth first search. 

In practice, <tt>(amb c1 c2 c3 ...)</tt>
makes a searching path that checks <tt>c1, c2, c3, ...</tt> in order
and  <tt>(amb)</tt> backtracks.
Thus, nondeterminism is a abstraction that hide searching from programmers.
Once we get <tt>amb</tt>, we can write logical programs easily without thinking what computers do.

<h2> 2. Implementation of nondeterminism</h2>

The backtrack used in the nondeterminism
is implemented as a chain of closures which is connected by current continuation.

The chain is represented by a global parameter <var>fail</var> which
is a function that rewrite itself.
<p>

<h3> 2.1. Implementation as a function</h3>

As a first step, I implement the nondeterminism using a function (named <span class='ttb'>choose</span>)
as shown in [code 1].

First I define a global parameter <var>fail</var>, whose initial value is a function that return  <tt>'no-choice</tt>
to the top level (lines 22 &ndash; 26).
Then the chain of closure is implemented by re-defining <var>fail</var> in the function <tt>choose</tt>.
Backtrack is represented by calling previous <var>fail</var>.
<p>
The function <tt>choose</tt> behaves like as follows:

<ol>
<li>if no choice, call  <tt>(fail)</tt>.
<li>if any,
  <ol>
    <li> stores the <tt>fail</tt> as <tt>fail0</tt> and call the current continuation.
    <li> re-defines the <tt>fail</tt> in the continuation. The new <tt>fail</tt> get back itself to the <tt>fail0</tt>
         and apply <tt>choose</tt> to the rest of choices.
    <li> returns the first choice to the out side of the continuation. 
 </ol>
</ol>

</pre>

Let's see if the <tt>choose</tt> can find a Pythagorean triple.
Function <tt>pythag</tt> is to find the triple.
It returns the list if it find, otherwise calls <tt>choose</tt> with no argument to backtrack.
<p>
[sample 1]
<pre class='samp'>
(define (sq x)
  (* x x))
<span class='response'>;Value: sq</span>

;;; Pythagorean triples
(define (pythag a b c)
  (if (= (+ (sq a) (sq b)) (sq c))
      (list a b c)
      (choose)))
<span class='response'>;Value: pythag</span>

(pythag (choose 1 2 3) (choose 3 4 5) (choose  4 5 6))
<span class='response'>;Value 16: (3 4 5)</span>
</pre>

<h3> 2.2. Implementation as a macro</h3>
To give S-expressions to the nondeterminism operator, the operator should be defined as a macro.
For instance, while a function <tt>an-integer-starting-from</tt> shown in [sample 2] should be return
a proper integer greater than or equal to <var>n</var>, it does not work because the argument is
evaluated immediately if <tt>choose</tt> (defined as function) is used to define the function.

<p>
[sample 2]
<pre class='samp'>
(define (an-integer-starting-from n)
  (choose n (an-integer-starting-from (1+ n))))
<span class='response'>;Value: an-integer-starting-from</span>

(an-integer-starting-from 1)
<span class='response'>;Aborting!: maximum recursion depth exceeded</span>
</pre>

To achieve this, let's define a nondeterminism macro  <span class='ttb'>amb</span> with consulting 
the definition of <tt>choose</tt> shown in [code 1].
The macro <tt>amb</tt> has the same structure as that of <tt>choose</tt> and calls itself recursively.
<p>
Lines 1 &ndash; 5 and 20 &ndash; 26 in the [code 1] are reused in the following codes.
<p>
When the [code 2] is compiled using the MIT-Scheme, the compiler warns like:
<pre>
;Warning: Possible inapplicable operator ()
</pre>
But it works properly.
The code works also on the
<a href='http://www.scheme.com/petitechezscheme.html'>
  Petite Chez Scheme</a>.
Even I have not tried other Scheme implementation, this definition of the <tt>amb</tt> 
could work on them if they follow R<sup>5</sup>RS.
You can download a  MIT-Scheme specific definition of the <tt>amb</tt> from
<a href='scheme_amb.zip'>here</a>. The compiler of the MIT-Scheme does not warn on the specific definition.

<span class="linenumber">13:</span>     		  (cc (amb b ...))))
<span class="linenumber">14:</span>     	  (cc a)))))))
</pre>

The macro definition, <tt>amb</tt>, works properly for arguments of S-expressions as well as those of values.
<p>
[sample 3]
<pre class='samp'>
(define (an-integer-starting-from n)
  (amb n (an-integer-starting-from (1+ n))))
<span class='response'>;Value: an-integer-starting-from</span>

expand the parameter using '<tt>,@(map .... )</tt>'.
Even they are straight forward definition, they are somehow complicated because 
they use <tt>call/cc</tt> twice. 
The recursive definition shown in [code 2] is simpler, even the expanded 
S-expression becomes some how complicated.

      <dd> It returns all the possibilities that satisfy <var>s</var>.
	The macro behaves like as follows:
      <ol>
<li>(Line 5) A list (<tt>acc</tt>) is defined, which holds the result that satisfies <var>s</var>.
<li>(Line 6) The result of <var>s</var> is assigned to <var>v</var> and is pushed to <var>acc</var>.
  If the result is pushed directly without <var>v</var> (like  <tt>(set! acc (cons s acc))</tt>),
  Only the last value is stored in the acc because <var>s</var> uses a continuation.
  The <var>s</var> changes the value of <tt>fail</tt>.

<li>(Lines 7,8) After that, it backtracks by calling <tt>fail</tt>. The function <tt>fail</tt> behaves as if it is
     called at line 6 because it uses <tt>call/cc</tt>.
<li>(Line 9) When all the possible choices are found, it calls <tt>(reverse! acc)</tt> and returns the all the
    possibilities.
    </ol>
The definition assume that the <tt>amb</tt> searches from the leftmost argument.

<h2>4. Summary</h2>
You can write programs that seems to be second-sighted when you use nondeterminism and the technique
is applied to logical programming and parsing.
Notice that you cannot use the code shown in this chapter if the searching path has loops.
